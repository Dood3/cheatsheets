NUMBER	    MEANING	                DESCRIPTION

S	          SID	                    Identifies the string as a SID.
1	          Revision Level	        To date, this has never changed and has always been 1.
5	          Identifier-authority	  A 48-bit string that identifies the authority 
                                    (the computer or network) that created the SID.
21	        Subauthority1	          This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group 
                                    described by the SID to the authority that created it. 
                                    It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account.
